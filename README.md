# Wildfire-Detection-ChapterX
This repository presents an in-depth exploration of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically U-Nets for wildfire detection. Leveraging Landsat-8 satellite imagery, the project evaluates the adaptability and performance of CNNs through various architectural configurations. It covers the entire workflow, from data collection and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and inference generation. This repository offers hands-on experience on how UNet CNNs can enhance detection accuracy through multispectral imaging.

# Objectives
## Project Set Up
This part of our guide will walk you through setting up the directory structure for the wildfire detection experiments. This Project set up will include installing required packages and preparing the enviroment for execution. 

- First create a project directory (WildfireDetection), on you local machine:
```
mkdir WildfireDetection
cd WildfireDetection
```
- Inside the project directory, create a data folder to store datasets and other required project files
```
mk Data
```

## Data 
This part of our guide assumes you have a empty `Data` directory. Here will will download the data required for this study. 

### A. Download Data from:
Move data to `Data` directory
