# Wildfire-Detection-ChapterX
This repository presents an in-depth exploration of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), specifically U-Nets for wildfire detection. Leveraging Landsat-8 satellite imagery, the project evaluates the adaptability and performance of CNNs through various architectural configurations. It covers the entire workflow, from data collection and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and inference generation. This repository offers hands-on experience on how UNet CNNs can enhance detection accuracy through multispectral imaging.
